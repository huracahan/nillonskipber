Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.Deploy first, ask questions later.Code without purpose is just wasted keystrokes.Pushing to production on a Friday should be illegal.Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.Don’t reinvent the wheel unless it’s broken.The best way to learn is to break something.The best debugging strategy is to assume you’re wrong.Automate everything.Coding is 1% writing and 99% debugging.If software was easy, everyone would do it.Good software is like a good joke—it needs no explanation.If it ain’t broke, improve it until it is."To-do" comments will never be done.Real devs use dark mode.If (code == ugly) { refactor(); }Real programmers don’t comment—if it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.Ctrl + S is my favorite keystroke.There’s no such thing as a simple software project.The best bugs hide in the smallest details.Fix it until it breaks.Programming is an endless cycle of solving problems you created for yourself.Git commit -am "WTF is this?"If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.The best code is self-explanatory.Segmentation fault (core dumped).Real programmers count from 0.Code like you mean it.A true programmer never blames the compiler.Premature optimization is the root of all evil.Code without purpose is just wasted keystrokes.I’d rather be coding.Don’t repeat yourself (DRY).The best code is self-explanatory.Ctrl + S is my favorite keystroke.Sometimes, the best debugging technique is to walk away.Git commit -am "WTF is this?"Software development is 90% Googling and 10% typing.First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.No code is better than bad code.Whitespace matters.The best bugs hide in the smallest details.Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.Code is read more often than it is written.Git blame is my favorite detective tool.Console.log(“Hello, debugging!”);There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.Don’t repeat yourself (DRY).Premature optimization is the root of all evil.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Programming is the closest thing we have to magic.Code like you mean it.No code is better than bad code.The best code is no code at all.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.addd
